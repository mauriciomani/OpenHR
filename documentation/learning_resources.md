# Learning Resources
This is a useful list of learning resources, though is not extensive it might help you find even more resources. This is are not advance courses, however, I highly recommend you start with basic programming concepts in any language. Remember the most important part is to **practice**. Still need to add a lot of resources for SQL, other programming languages, frameworks, etc. Please add any you have find useful.
