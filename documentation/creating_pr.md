# Guide for Pull Request (PR)
Please read the following [file](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), to learn more about PR. This is a short guide on how to create a PR **completely online from any web browser**. 

### Online PR creation
On the right corner of this repository please find the **fork** icon. When click it you will create a copy of this repository in your github account, this will not be downloaded to you machine, unless you want so.
![fork](../repo_images/fork_icon.png)
Once done the above make sure you are in the forked repository and find the files that you want to edit. Inside the file find the **pencil icon**, click it, and you are ready to edit the file. 
![edit](../repo_images/edit_file.png)
You can also create files if needed. Once you have finish scroll down to the **commit changes** section, there please add necessary information to your commit. Make sure to create a new branch and give it a representative name (you can also commit directly to the main branch). Once you have done that you might get redirected to a Pull Request form, just exit without doing anything, since this form is for creating a pull request to the forked repository and not to the original repository. 
![commit](../repo_images/commit.png)
Go to the **main repository view** and click in the PR icon showed, not the one aside code icon.

If you have created a branch (and have not merged to main) please select it next to the forked repository as shown in the image and **click on create pull request**
![create_pr](../repo_images/create_PR.png)
Finally, just make sure there is a description for your PR and click again on **create Pull Request**. You will not be able to merge it, you can reference a user such as @mauriciomani and we will be glad to approve it.
